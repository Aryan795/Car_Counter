ðŸš— Real-Time Car Counter using OpenCV & YOLOv8
A Python-based vehicle detection and counting system that uses YOLOv8 (via CVZone) for object detection and OpenCV for real-time video processing. The project counts cars crossing a predefined line in a video stream, with potential applications in traffic monitoring, parking management, and smart city analytics.

ðŸ”¥ Features

âœ” YOLOv8 Object Detection â€“ High-accuracy car detection.
âœ” Line Crossing Logic â€“ Tracks vehicles passing a virtual line.
âœ” Real-Time Visualization â€“ Displays bounding boxes, counts, and FPS.
âœ” Easy-to-Use â€“ Works with videos, IP cameras, or live streams.
